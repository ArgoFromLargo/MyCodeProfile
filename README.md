# Systems and Networks I
Focuses on the ins-and-outs of operating systems. Some projects completeded during this course include utilizing `fork()` or `pthread_create()`. All of these projects were written in C.


# Systems and Networks II
Focuses on each layer of networks. Projects during this course include creating a functional token ring, implementing RDT protocol to send messages from sender to receiver and back, and implementing protocols to send messages from simulated routers to other routers with neighboring router info, followed by building forwarding tables once all router info had flooded the network. All 3 of these projects were written in C.


# Programming Languages
An overview of programming languages in general as well as in depth hands on learning with some of them. These languages include Python, Scala, and Clojure.
