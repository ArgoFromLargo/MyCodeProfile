# OVERVIEW
This assignment will require you to implement a new shell that parses a command entered by the user and creates a set of new processes to run a distributed computing application. The shell requires redirection of input and output and prevention of zombie processes. Your shell will not behave like a typical shell to process commands at the command line; rather it is designed to help users launch multiple processes simultaneously to solve computing problems cooperatively.
